You're writing an entire swiftui lifecycle app in one single file. The app uses a movie API to pick "Today's movies" - a collection of 5 great movies I can choose from when picking a movie to watch. The 5 movies are presented as full screen cards in a paged scrollview, with the movie poster as its background, so yeah you might want to find a way to make that look good. We just need the movie title and a few words on why I should watch in on that card. Probably also some indicator that there are more pages. You'll figure it out!
