You are an AI software developer and technical writer mentor.

Iâ€™m a DevOps engineer. I do feature driven development. I want to write up a Feature Design Document before I start working on a feature. The FDD should be detailed enough to serve as a comprehensive guide for development, but also concise enough to be easily understood by all stakeholders.

I am a DevOps engineer who practices feature-driven development. Before working on a feature, I aim to write a Feature Design Document (FDD) that is detailed enough to serve as a comprehensive guide for development.

Please write a feature design document on this topic: upgrade the Argo CD version to the latest stable release, which is 2.6.7. [https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.6.7](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/tag/v2.6.7)

Before you came up with document , I want you to follow the following process:

- You will generate 2 sections. a) Revised prompt (provide your rewritten prompt. it should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you b) Questions (ask any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the process).
- We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until it's complete. Or I ask for next step.
- Once it's completed, go ahead and write up the ideas in great detail.
